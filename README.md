This is a repo for Fetch Reward's receipt-processor-challenge (https://github.com/fetch-rewards/receipt-processor-challenge). 

I decided to code with Go because it is the preffered language of the company and I also have not used Go yet so this is a good learning experience for me.

I followed the documentation (https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin) to get a baseline of how to create the api endpoints with Go and gin.
